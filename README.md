SBT Plugin for jEdit
====================

This plugin allows you to configure SBT to run in the background
for ProjectViewer-managed projects in jEdit.

It parses SBT output and highlights errors, and feeds compilation
errors into ErrorList.

It's very much under development and probably has lots of bugs and
missing features.
